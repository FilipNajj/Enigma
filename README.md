# Enigma Machine
This is a variant of the Enigma machine used during the WWII that encrypts/decrypts any text entered by the user.

How it works : 
* Run the code.
* Enter a 3 triplet key like this : In the 1st box of each triplet, type R1, R2 or R3 in any order but without repeating the same key. In the 2nd box, type either G or D for each triplet. In the 3rd box, type any negative or postive number.
* Before typing your text, press "Configurer".
* Enter your text.
* Press "Encrypter" to encrypt the 1st letter, then press "Etape suivante".
* Repeat last step for each letter until done.

Have fun!
